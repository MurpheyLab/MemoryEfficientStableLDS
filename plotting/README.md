# Plotting instructions 
In this directory, you will find instructions on how to generate the plots that appear in our paper once you have obtained the relevant results.

## Memory Demands
To reproduce the plot about memory usage (Figure 1 of our paper), you will need to run `MemoryDemands/memory_calculation.m`. If you need to generate this plot for your own results, simply change the `path_to_data` and `dims` variables appearing `MemoryDemands/memory_calculation.m` according to your needs.

## Error Performance for Dynamic Texture Datasets
To reproduce the plots about error performance on the dynamic texture datasets (Figure 2 of our paper), you will need to run `DynamicTexture/plots.m`. 

## Control Experiments
In the `ControlExperiments/` directory you will find scripts to produce Figure 5 and Figure 6 from our paper.
