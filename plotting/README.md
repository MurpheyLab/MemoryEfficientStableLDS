# Plotting instructions 

The `BenchmarkDatasets` directory is used to plot the best error frequency, average reconstruction error, and average execution time of the stable LDS models obtained by SOC, CG, and WLS algorithms. 
To do this, run the `plots.m` file. 

The `MemoryDemands` directory is used to plot the memory required by SOC, CG, and WLS to run for different number of dimensinons. To do this, run the `memory_calculation.m` file.
